Understanding the Basics of SQL Database: SELECT Queries, Table Joins, and Query Conditions

SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a relational database.
		The fundamental concepts of SQL include:
		   1)SELECT Queries – Retrieving data from tables
		   2)Table Joins – Combining data from multiple tables
		   3)Query Conditions – Filtering data based on conditions

   1)SELECT Queries – Retrieving Data from a Table
		a)The SELECT statement is used to fetch data from a database table. 
		b)It allows retrieving specific columns or all columns from a table.

	🔹 Basics of SELECT
		a)Retrieving all columns: The * symbol is used to fetch all columns from a table.
		b)Retrieving specific columns: We can specify the column names to fetch only the required data.
	    c)Renaming columns: The AS keyword allows renaming columns for better readability.

	📌 Example Scenarios
		Fetching all employees from the database
		Retrieving only the names and salaries of employees.


   2️) Table Joins – Combining Data from Multiple Tables
        a)In relational databases, data is stored in multiple tables that are connected through foreign keys.
		JOIN operations help retrieve related data from these tables.

	 🔹 Types of Table Joins
		a)INNER JOIN – Returns only matching records from both tables.
		b)LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
		c)RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN) – Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
		d)FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN) – Returns all records from both tables, even if no match is found.

	📌 Example Scenarios
		Finding employee details along with department names
		Retrieving a list of students with their respective subjects


   3️) Query Conditions – Filtering Data Based on Criteria

		 a)The WHERE clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions.

	🔹 Common Query Conditions
		a)Filtering based on a single condition (= operator).
		b)Using multiple conditions (AND, OR).
		c)Finding records within a range (BETWEEN).
		d)Searching for patterns in text (LIKE).
		e)Filtering based on missing values (IS NULL).

	📌 Example Scenarios
		a)Retrieving all employees who work in the IT department
		b)Finding students who scored more than 80 marks
		c)Listing all customers whose names start with 'A'


   4) Understanding SQL Aggregate Functions

        a)Aggregate functions in SQL perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single summarized value. 
		b)These functions are commonly used with the GROUP BY clause to categorize and analyze data.

	Common Aggregate Functions
		Function	Description	                    Example Use Case
		a)COUNT()	Counts the number of rows	    Count the total number of employees
		b)SUM()	    Adds up all numeric values	    Calculate total sales revenue
		c)AVG()	    Calculates the average value	Find the average salary of employees
		d)MAX()	    Finds the highest value	        Get the highest marks in a class
		e)MIN()	    Finds the lowest value	        Find the lowest product price
